Scenario 1: Add Employee

1) The spelling of "Dependants" is somewhat unusual, especially in the US. I would expect "Dependents" with no "a".
2) The Dependants field seems to accept an arbitrarily large value, which may not be desired. (Maybe cap at 99? Less?)
3) There seems to be a missing penny for Net Pay on the following IDs:
   - 297103cc-29e5-4965-9796-d0d411ffe47c
   - 9e5de040-0f4a-44b3-8c46-a3e4a247bd68
   - ae6d227b-df88-4b03-8fcc-d0d568325a6a
   - ed208e21-3058-4d7f-8d5b-6fb25b4fe35e
Repro: add benefit cost to net pay, expect it equal gross pay, but in these cases it is a penny short


Scenario 2: Edit Employee

4) The Edit employee button/icon opens the Add Employee dialog, and still says "Add Employee" which could be confusing to the user. Suggest changing the title to "Update Employee". 
 



Scenario 3: Delete Employee

5)
